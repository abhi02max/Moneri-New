            <p>
              Moneri Spa & Academy was born from the vision of our founder, Monisha Roy. With over 15 years in the wellness industry, Monisha dreamed of a space where women could not only receive world-class treatments but also feel deeply seen, cared for, and empowered.

              She envisioned a haven that blended the precision of modern aesthetic science with the timeless wisdom of holistic healing. It wasn't just about beauty; it was about creating moments of profound peace and confidence that resonate long after a visit.
